# tabconv

This is a very simple program that converts tabs to spaces for source code, but
respects tab stops. Tabs within double-quoted strings are preserved.  If you've
used tabs to align table columns, for example when setting values in
enumerations, then the output should still look just like the input, only with
spaces in place of the tabs.

## Why?

There are probably a bunch of programs that do this already, but this was fun.

If it's useful, then that's also a bonus.

## License

I place this code in the public domain.  Do anything you'd like with it.
